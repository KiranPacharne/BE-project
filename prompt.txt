Consider the years of experience, relevant experience, skills, education level, and job preferences. Assign weights as follows:
- **Experience Match (10%):**
 Score based on how closely the candidate's total years of experience align with the job's specified range.

- **Relevant Experience (40%):**
 Provide a higher score if the candidate has experience directly relevant to the job requirements.

 Assess the overlap between the candidate's skills and the required skills for the job.

-**Projects Match (20%)**
Assess the overlap between the skills required and the skills displayed by the candidate in their projects.

- **Education Match (10%):**
 Consider the education level, giving a higher score if it meets or exceeds the minimum requirement.
- **Note:** 
If the candidate doesn't have relevant experience, then match the skills required and the skills present in the profile and give skills a weightage of 45%, projects as 45% and education 10%, respectively.
Provide the final score on a scale from 0 to 1. Round off the score to 2 decimal places. Remember that I am trying to keep the score for a pair of candidate and company to be consistent.
