IoTIoT Remote Work
•Deployed Computer vision applications on Edge/BrainyPi including object detection, pose estimation, style
transfer, super resolution and image segmentation.
•Created an object detection API using FastAPI.
•Tensorflow custom Object Detector and transfer learning using caffe framework.
PROJECTS
YOLOV3 from scratch. Created you only look once(yolo) detector using pytorch, built up all the layers including
shortcut and route layers. The detector made 3 predictions for 3 different grids (total 9 anchors). Objectness score
thresholding, IOU, input and output pipelines and the forward pass were constructed from scratch using only the
official yolo config file. (Link)
Custom Object Detection API. Custom Object Detector built using yolov5 and FastAPI. Dataset created and
annotated using robloflow. (Link)
Disease Prediction using Symptoms Web project built using NodeJS, Express and MongoDB which works as a
symptom checker. The project was upgraded to include Machine learning algorithms for making a prediction. (Link)
