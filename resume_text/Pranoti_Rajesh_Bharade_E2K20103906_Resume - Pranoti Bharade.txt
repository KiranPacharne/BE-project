Automatic Motion Detection Using PIR sensor: 
Reduction of power consumption by automatically controlling the
Bulbs/lights/fans, with respect to detection of human motion; rather
than use of manual switching system. 
Maze Solving Robot:
This robot is equipped with three infrared sensors to check the path for
right, left, and straight direction. The robot is able to move
automatically in many mazes, and reach the final destination. It uses
the LSRU algorithm to solve the entire path.
Fire Fighting Robot:
The robot is equipped with flame sensors that help us detect fire. The
proposed vehicle has a water pump, and servo motor and a spray which
is able to extinguish fire at a faster rate.
Cotton De-seeder:
Engineered a high-precision cotton deseeder achieving 68% accuracy,
tactfully adjusted speed (60 RPM) to prevent seed damage, enhancing
overall deseeding efficiency
