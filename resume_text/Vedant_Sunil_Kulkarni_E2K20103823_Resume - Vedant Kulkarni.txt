PROJECTS 
Stock Market Price Prediction using LSTM
 
 
Worked on developing a stock prediction system using 
LSTM algorithm
 of
Deep Learning 
Gathered information on more than
 25 
top stocks
 in the Indian share market 
Completed their analysis using 
Power BI
, created an individual dashboard for
every stock, implemented LSTM algorithm to predict stock prices and built
GUI using 
streamlit
 framework 
Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning
 
 
Worked on project for Diabetes prediction using the dataset, developing
predictive system using ML algorithms, developed basic UI using python's
streamlit framework 
Used 
Knn algorithm 
to ﬁnd out whether a person has chance of have
diabetes depending on parameters like age,glucose,blood
pressure,BMI,Pregnancies,insulin levels etc 
Used python's inbuit 
streamlit framework
 to create a GUI for user
friendliness 
Banking System using Java 
Developed a Java-based banking system using 
Swing 
and JDBC 
database
connectivity that allows bank customers to create and manage their
accounts, make deposits and withdrawals, view transaction history, and
transfer funds between accounts. 
The system also allows bank employees to manage customer accounts, view
account details, and generate reports. 
DC-DC Buck Converter using Fuzzy Logic Control 
Improved the performance
 of normal buck converter 
by applying fuzzy
logic
 control to the converter 
Also created a 
MATLAB-Simulink
 simulation to compare performance a
normal buck converter and a buck converter implemented using fuzzy logic
