Projects
ML Marks Prediction Web Application |https://github.com/AmeyRathi12/ml-project
•This machine learning project aims to predict students’ exam scores based on various features such as gender, race
ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course. The project utilizes multiple ML models and
provides a Flask web application for users to input their data and get exam score predictions.
•Tech Stack: Python for coding, Flask for web app, HTML/CSS for UI, Pandas/NumPy for data handling, Scikit-learn
for ML models, Pickle for object serialization, Git/GitHub for version control, Docker for containerization, GitHub
Actions for automated workflows, AWS for deployment.
•This project is a comprehensive end-to-end web application, featuring modular coding aligned with industry standards.
It encompasses machine learning, data analysis, and object-oriented programming principles
AI-PDF Chat |https://github.com/AmeyRathi12/pdf-chat
•An innovative PDF chatbot project designed for intelligent conversations, entirely powered by your computer’s
processing capabilities. This project demonstrates seamless communication, offering user- friendly interactions without
the need for external systems
•This project leverages a powerful combination of technologies, including Streamlit for interactive UI, Transformers for
advanced language processing, and SentenceTransformer for text embeddings. It also incorporates Chroma vector store
for efficient data handling.
•In this project, the core concept revolves around natural language processing (NLP), text embeddings, and data
structuring. The La-MINI T-5 model drives the chatbot’s intelligent conversations, showcasing the capabilities of large
language models. Notably, the entire application operates using your computer’s CPU, ensuring smooth interactions
without external API dependencies.
