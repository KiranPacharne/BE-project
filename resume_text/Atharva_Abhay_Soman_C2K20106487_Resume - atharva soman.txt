Projects /githublink for latest/ongoing (2023) projects
Hands Sign Classifier |/githublink
•In this project I have tried to classify human hand signs into 4 categories: thumbs up,
thumbs down, livelong, thank you.
•There are two notebooks used: one for collecting the images and other for training and detecting
the class of images.
•At the end my model can classify both images and a real time video hand signs efficiently.
•For future scope I will build an app which will translate the sign language into significant sentence
Fire Classifier |/githublink
•Research Project : Built and tested different Hybrid Neural Networks for classifying images containing
fires as controlled or uncontrolled fires with improved accuracy.
AutoML Webapp |/githublink
•Using streamlit, I created a platform for profiling, modeling of any dataset.
•In this I have made use of pycaret library for modeling and data vis. Front end uses streamlit.
Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Reviews |/githublink
•This model classifies reviews into 3 categories: good, neutral, bad
•This model implements nltk library and a pretrained model of Roberta.
Book Recommender System |/githublink
•This project is a platform where readers can view ratings of a book and compare with other books
•It uses collaborative filtering implementing cosine similarity.
